<h1 class="f-mont-26">HELLO!</h1>
<p class="f-mont-19 txt-space-1-5">I'm Corrin, a cat-loving, coffee-drinking, card-carrying feminist. I'm also an artist and developer based in Somerville, MA. I work primarily in acrylic, marker, digital illustration, collage, and film to create works dealing with feminism, my mental space, and domestic environments. When I'm not creating art and websites, I spend my time rock climbing, eating sushi, and smooching my satanic cat, Tilly.</p>
